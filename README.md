# Study: Non Sporeforming Thermoduric Bacteria in Dairy
# Authors: Caroline Motzer, Martin Wiedmann, Nicole Martin
This study focused on identifying heat resistances in non sporeforming thermoduric bacteria in skim milk broth as a way to identify an alternative test methods to the LPC test that result in bacterial populations that might more closely resemble popluations found after HTST.

Thermoduricdata_R.csv is the raw data and thermo_v3.Rmd is the r code needed to create the linear models and conduct statistics
